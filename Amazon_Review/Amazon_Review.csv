  ¬†Another beauty from Apple. I was upgraded from iPhone X and it was great experience with all the latest specs and flawlessly smooth. Thanks to all new A14 Bionic chip.Build quality was great as always from Apple.Phone feels light on hands due to aluminium body. I chose Blue colour because wanted to go for different colour than routine Black and white iPhones so initially I was bit skeptical but after seeing the phone in person I‚Äôm happy with the blue colour  ‚Äú not bad at all and not too flashy‚ÄùGrip and feel perfect. Phone comes with iOS 14.1. Camera quality was excellent and sufficient  as a normal user.If you are from iOS ecosystem nothing will go wrong here.There is nothing to question about the quality and interface from Apple ( it‚Äôs my personal opinion as a long time apple user)As you all know iPhone 12 won‚Äôt comes with earphones and charging brick( adapter)I bought separately 20w apple adapter from new Apple India online store for Rs.1900I don‚Äôt judge here apple because of accessories removal and the price tag. I hope apple can justify this.I only hope and wanted to see so badly Made in India IPhones so that we all can enjoy lower priced ( at least a better priced) iPhones in the future.A big thanks to Appario Retail Pvt. Ltd and Amazon for delivering genuine iPhone as always in perfect condition. Delivered way before the promised date.Update: (01/12/2020) After testing 25 days especially on battery life of this iPhone 12, results were amazing and I‚Äôm completely satisfied  with the battery performance. On Moderate gaming, Moderate Video Content, heavy on calls and heavy on browsing this iPhone 12 battery life is sufficient for your regular Day.My conclusion is definitely a better and improved battery performer than the previous iPhone model.Thank you Apple IndiaThank you Appario Retail Pvt. Ltd.Thank you Amazon India.( Note: charger brick was shown in my video was bought myself from Apple India online store because it won‚Äôt comes with the phone)"
3,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Black,This phone is a joke and the joke is on us!!! Don‚Äôt buy this phone.,1.0,"Extremely disappointed with this phone. It‚Äôs a seemingly average phone which is over priced by 4 to 5 times at least. This phone is a joke in comparison with any Samsung flagship phone. I am shocked that so many fools like me are falling for apple‚Äôs trickery and gimmickry.The battery doesn‚Äôt last half a day. Screen size is average. Thickness of this phone will constantly remind you that this phone belongs to another era. 64gb space won‚Äôt be enough for anyone.And then there are other apple quirks - won‚Äôt come with a SD card, won‚Äôt come with a charging brick or a set of head phones. Your headphones with the regular audio pin won‚Äôt work with this one. Face ID won‚Äôt work with masks on. So your forced to remove your masks when you‚Äôre out and vulnerable. This phone won‚Äôt allow you set google maps as default. So you continue to suffer using their apple map which I bet even Tim Cook doesn‚Äôt use. You won‚Äôt be able to set google chrome as your default browser as iOS won‚Äôt let you.Overall the phone is overpriced and overrated. Anybody with half the wit will figure that this phone is a joke and a mere marketing gimmick. An ordinary phone like this shouldn‚Äôt cost you more than 12 to 14K.Apple is going down!Amazon won‚Äôt take this phone back as they have a 10 day return policy. So I am pretty much stuck with this damn excuse for a phone till I get to upgrade to a Samsung phone."
4,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Black,The Beast,5.0,"This was my first switch to an ios device after using an android untill now. And I am not disappointed. The build quality, the responsive touch, the display, the camera, the battery life are just exceptional.Been using for about 10 days now, and consistently giving around 7h of screen on time.The camera is just way too good. Espeecially the night mode impressed me a lot.Only issue when switching from Android to iPhone I encountered was to be not able to restore my whatsapp chats. There are no official/free ways for doing this.The phone is simple amazing."
5,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Black,Don't Buy from Amazon,1.0,If you are planning to buy an iphone then please buy from stores only.I got a defective product and when I complain about it to amazon customer care and requested for replacement they simply deny to replace it.Don't waste your money.
6,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Black,Beastü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©,4.0,"Hello there,I am writing this review after 3-4 days of usage, Iphone 12 is a beast in terms of:-MemoryBuild qualityCameraProcessorDisplayExcept battery there‚Äôs rumour going on that iPhone 12 battery is bad or worst, so i am here to clarify all your doubts,iPhone battery will last easily a day but not more than that and here‚Äôs some condition that you should aware about1. If you are using your phone on wifi than it will last a day easily without any problem.2. If you are on 4g than it will not last a day for example, if you fully charged your phone at 8 am than it will last till 8 pm not more than that and this happen if you‚Äôre on 4g continuously otherwise it will last about 10 pm.Here‚Äôs some tip you should do after buying iPhone 12, watch video on YouTube to know ‚ÄúHow to save battery on iPhone 12‚Äù this will help you increase your battery life as well battery health.For my experience, i think you should go for this device without any second thoughts & those who don‚Äôt have any tech knowledge and thinking of buying this then I recommend you to go for android because iOS has complicate settings than android...you will regret after buying it.Got original product Btw!!!!!"

8,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Black,Not Really worth the money,4.0,"I have been an android user for the past 8+ years. Recently was using iphone 6 for the past few months, liked it much and wanted to switch to ios. I did not want to regret, so i purchased the best in the market, going with iphone 12. Honestly, I dont feel its worthy. Perfomance wise, its good. A lot other phones like MI, 1+ everything gives us a very nice perfomance too. The A14 chip is just a tag line to sell the phone. Are we really going to process million instructions per second on a mobile phone? Defenitely not.Battery, After charging it to 100% in the morning, I am hardly getting 1 full day with average use. My battery is almost 20% at the end of the day with a screentime of 4-4.3 hours[Update : With low power mode, it makes a 6 hour day, ending with 30%]. Camera quality is amazing in natural light. Yes, as specified it works so nice in night light, but please dont mistake night light as no-light. Front camera is still average. The same things i see in every other mid range android phones. I am still using JIO 4g. Not sure how this would work on 5g (must drain even faster)Face detenction, the color of the phone, Water resistant and all stuffs are nice to have, fancy items.  But not really convinced if this is all we get for 84k?Fast charging - I bought a 20W charger from apple store for Rs.1900. I plug in when the battery is 20-25% and it takes 1.45 hours to reach 100%. If this is all about fast charging you are looking for, well and good. I never tried with magsafe, honestly. But this to me doesnt seem fast charging for 2800~ mah battery.I wont say that this phone is too poor. It gives us all that it promises. Personally I dont recommend investing 85k Indian money into this. Either go for lower versions of other iphones like 11 or you can wait for an year and buy this at cheaper cost.PROS : Camera & PerfomanceCONS : Battery and Cost"
9,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Black,"Activation Failed, this product was not recognized by Apple official website.",1.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                




  ¬†Bad experience! I have purchased Iphone from Amazon before as well but this time the activation of new iphone 12 failed when I was setting it up. I tried contacting Apple support but the serial number mentioned on the box was invalid. I really don't know if it is a counterfeit product or there is some technical issue but one thing is sure that Apple's Website is not recognising the IMEI and serial Number of new Iphone 12 I bought from here"
10,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Black,"Performance is excellent,battery draining too fast and heating issue",4.0,"I am writing this review after 40 days of use of iPhone 12. phone camera is excellent like DSLR ,very fast processor ,face ID feature looks great ,overall everything is fine but only issue which this phone has is , battery draining too fast. You can use 100% battery only for 5-6 hours of continuous use after that you have to charge it. Apple should look into this."
11,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Black,How to decide between iPhone 11 and 12,4.0,"After thinking a lot, I decided to go ahead with iPhone 12. The original price is ‚Çπ 84900. After credit card discount(‚Çπ6000), old phone exchange(‚Çπ3450) and reward points money(‚Çπ4530) inclusion, I bought it for ‚Çπ70920. There‚Äôs also an additional 3000 discount on red and white variants but I couldn‚Äôt let go of blue1. PRICE: Considering iPhone 11 would be supported by iOS for 4 years, based on the current price it‚Äôd cost 13k per year and iPhone 12 for 5 years would cost 14.9k(excluding exchange discount) per year. For me price gap for both phones didn‚Äôt seem to make a huge difference as IPhone 11 is already an year old and costing only a 2k less per year.2: DISPLAY: I‚Äôve purchased iPhone 11 for my mom last year and been observing the display for some months. Compared to iPhone 11, the iPhone 12 display is far superior and has better pixel quality.3: BEZELS: the bezels of iPhone 12 are much thinner and makes the phone look decent unlike in 11. Apart from this, the phone is incredibly light making it easy to hold it.How to choose between 64/128gb:If you‚Äôre not really tight on budget, I‚Äôd suggest to go for 128gb variant. I‚Äôve been using one plus for 1.5 years and storage  occupied about 60gb. So it‚Äôd make good sense to check your current phone usage. Either way you can also opt for iCloud 50gb storage which would cost approximately the difference amount of 64 and 128 go for 5 years.CONS:1. Could have definitely included the charger for the price2. If you‚Äôre an android user, migration would be little time consumingUpdate: I‚Äôve uploaded a couple of pictures shot using automatic night mode. :)"
12,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Black,No USB,1.0,1st thing is there is no USB adapterI.e. u need to buy adapter and it will cost u around 500Also no EarphonesApple has became very worse
13,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Black,Apparaio Retail & Amazon doing absolute frauds with customers,1.0,I purchased new apple iphone12 with exchange of my samsung m31. from day1 while charging the body is conducting electricity .replaced chargers but still same issue. cross checked earthing of home-it is fine . then contacted apple support . they told me to get a replacement from the seller but amazon is just avoiding to replace. they asked emails proofs of case id of apple support. I provided them but still they are not assuring replacement . They sell defective products and do not replace. THIS IS DISGUSTING

16,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Black,One beast of a phone.,5.0,"I am writing this after a week of my usage with this iPhone 12. I have had the X before and OnePlus 6T as well.Overall experience of switching to iOS again is so good. The Interface, the speed, smoothness, camera, support, and everything is so well crafter.I‚Äôll be talking about the pros and cons with respect to the apple standards of course.Pros:1. The design is absolutely wonderful, its very very light weight and premium feeling phone with vintage boxy look.2. The speed, the performance.3. Camera of course. The normal picture comes out pretty good, they don‚Äôt usually need any professional touch.4. Battery life - I‚Äôll talk about the battery life in day to day life instead of nerdy Screen On Time. I am a doctor and usually don‚Äôt play much games on this but I surf web a lot, youtube videos, social media and a lot of WhatsApp and sometimes heavy use for 10% of the time. It can get through one day pretty easily with around 8-9 hr Screen on time, 10hr Stand by time, so you can relate now. Don‚Äôt believe that it has bad battery, it has a pretty good battery.ConsNothing much until now.The back of the phone is fingerprint magnet, attracts a lot of them.Another concern was the charging adapter which is not provided in the box."
17,Apple iPhone 12 (128GB) - Black,Confused? Read on! One stop review for your flagship purchase.,5.0,"I went through a lot of reviews and articles before I decided on the iPhone 12. I‚Äôve been an Android user all my life and frankly thought Apple phones were really overpriced(at least here in India). But in the present day, the flagship Android options are no less expensive. If you spend a lot of time on your mobile, using it as your primary camera, social media device, business emails/collaboration and also to stream videos then you definitely need to spend a little more and go with a flagship option for the best experience.Coming to the flagships today (Aug2021),  apart from the iPhone we have Samsung Galaxy S21/+/ultra, Oneplus 9 pro, Vivo x60 pro+, mi 11ultra.  If you read a few reviews you‚Äôll understand that 888Snapdragon has a lot of heating issues  and 9pro cameras didn‚Äôt live up to the hype(also overheating when the camera is in use). Samsung in India ships the phone with exynos2100 which is way less powerful than 888. The prices of all these phones are in the same range (except the ultra). Imp note: iOS updates are across iPhone devices unlike the android updates.Apple has really done a lot of things right on the iPhone12:1. They changed its display from lcd to led (huge value jump)2. A14 Bionic chip is a really fast and smooth without any lag3. Huge improvement on the primary cameras. Still the best video recording phone in the market and the photos are top quality4. The change is the body design is really comfortable in the hand5. The haptics are spot onWhat‚Äôs Missing: (Minor misses though)1. The Notch. Really wish they get rid of the notch but looks like it wont be out until 2023. Anyway you‚Äôll get used to it.2. USB type C charging. The iPad Pro 2020 model onwards already comes with the TypeC usb charging. I guess the iPhone 13 would get this change3. Fingerprint Sensor: Yes. Apple had done away with it couple of years back but with the pandemic still on, you sometimes wish there was a fingerprint sensorWait for the iPhone 13 or go with the 12:It took a while for 12‚Äôs prices to fall.  If you‚Äôre willing to wait till Feb-March 2022 for a good deal then wait for the 13. If you want to change it now, go with the 12.64GB or 128GB:The difference is around ‚Çπ6000.  64GB if you don‚Äôt play too many games and keep dumping the media files every once in while to your pc/storage . Else, the 128üòäBattery:I was indeed very surprised with the battery life. Charging time is a little slower compared to  it‚Äôs competition but the back up is impressive. It easily lasts a day.Android Flagship Option:The truth is, right now is not a good time to purchase an android flagship. If you really want to buy an android flagship, do wait for a while. 895 snapdragon phones are expected to be out by end of the year or early 2022.Hope this review helped :)Update:13 gets a better cam sensor, a15 bionic, 10% bigger battery and a slightly smaller notch. That‚Äôs it. No more differences. Everything else remains the same.iPhone 13 launched at 80k which is lesser than 12‚Äôs launch price(86k).  If you want to save on some cash , 12 will still  do the job (12 is currently around 55k-62k).  However if you can spend that extra 20k, then 13 should be your pick.Planning on taking an Android? Definitely wait until early 2022."

  ¬†Dear Team,Please be informed that I am very dissatisfied by the services provided by Amazon buying this much expensive mobile from Amazon is not worth I believe they always provide us the defected item I recently purchased I phone 12 and it is creating a problem while switching on had to try multiple times for the same and this problem occurs every time whenever I switch off the mobile last time also the same issue occur when I bought my One plus 08 there was issue related to camera image was getting blurred each time and then I have to replace it I think Amazon just sell defected items I am very angry and wil take it forward because it's second time in a row and will never suggest any one to buy mobile especially from Amazon and also want to post the review about this on social media"
